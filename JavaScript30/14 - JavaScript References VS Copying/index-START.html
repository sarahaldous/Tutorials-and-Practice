// let age = 100;
// age2 = age
// console.log(age, age2)
// age = 200
// console.log(age, age2)

// let name = 'Wes'

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log( players, team)
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = "Lux";
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
   
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    // spread takes every item out of your iterable and puts it into the containing array (or could spread into a function, too)
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'hee haw'
    console.log(team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    //cannot do this:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});
    console.log(cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread. Just like spreading into an array, but into an object
    const cap3 = {...person}
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.log(wes)

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    //object.asssign is just one level deep. If you need to use it in a function, you need to look online to find "deepclone", but consider carefully whether you need that or not.
    // to do sort of the same, you could do "poor man's deepClone":
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    //pass it an object, it turns it to a string, then you JSON.parse it to turn it back to an object, and you don't end up with any of the references.
